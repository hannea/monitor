# Function that counts alarm and alarm rate. It uses splines fitted to the means
# of quantiles and is therefore sensitive to the knots, due to the decreased sample size.
# Input: takes a training and test set of load and vibrations, vector of knots,
# number of bins and the minimum load included in the calculations.
# So far it is still neccessary to define the knots manually.
# output: count of alarms and alarm rate, and a plot of log of the vibrations
# against load, splines fitted to the means and 3 standard diviations above and
# below the means and alarms in the test set is plotted.

#' Count and plot alarms using a spline using heterogeneous variance.
#'
#' Function that divides \code{load_training} into quantiles using \code{bins} as the number
#' of quantiles.
#' For each quantile, the mean and standard deviation are calculated. A spline is fitted to the
#' means and two splines are fitted to three sigmas above and below the means, respectively.
#' The function generates alarms when the test data fall outside the band of three sigmas.
#' The function generates a plot by default, and can also show the summary of the quantiles if
#' \code{show_summary = TRUE}.
#'
#' @param load_training A vector containing the training data of the load variables such as power or generator speed.
#' @param vib_training A vector containing the training data of the vibration signal.
#' @param knots A vector containing the locations of the knots.
#' @param load_test A vector with the test data of the load variable.
#' @param vib_test A vector with the test data of the vibration signal.
#' @param show_figure A logical vector indicating if a plot should be made.
#' @param show_summary A logical vector stating whether the quantile summaries should be shown or not.
#' @param bins The number of bins used.
#' @param load_min The minimum load to be used.
#'
#' @return  A list of the count of the number of alarms, alarm rate, and residuals. Furthermore, a plot is
#' generated by default, set by \code{show_figure}.
#' \item{count}{A count of the number of alarms in the test set.}
#' \item{alarm_rate}{The alarm rate in the test set.}
#' \item{residuals}{The residuals in the test set.}
